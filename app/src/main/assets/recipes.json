      "attribute": "[2003] 2 AC 541",
      "category": "Consideration",
      "facts": "In May 1999 SGG, as employer, contracted with the first defendant ('Inglen') as main contractor for the construction of a float glass factory. Actionstrength subsequently entered into a labour-only subcontract with Inglen. Actionstrength encountered difficulties with late payments by Inglen and periodically threatened to pull its workforce off the site. In response to one such threat SGG orally agreed that, if Actionstrength would keep its workmen on the site, it would ensure that Actionstrength would receive the amounts due to it from Inglen, if necessary by redirecting amounts it was due to pay to Inglen for onward payment to Actionstrength. Inglen subsequently defaulted on its obligations to both SGG and Actionstrength. By this action Actionstrength sought to recover the amount due to it from both Inglen and SGG. SGG resisted the claim based on the oral agreement on the ground that the agreement constituted a guarantee by it of Inglen's liability to Actionstrength and was unenforceable, since there was no note or memorandum thereof for the purposes of s.4 Statute of Frauds 1677. Mitting J held that the oral agreement was capable of being construed as an acceptance by SGG of a primary obligation to Actionstrength. Actionstrength contended that the designation in the promise by SGG to pay monies out of a specific fund or source, namely monies due from it to Inglen, took the agreement outside s.4 of the Act.",
      "judgment": "It was clear that SGG had agreed to take on a secondary liability to answer for the default of Inglen, who remained primarily liable. It followed that the agreement gave rise to a guarantee only. Since there was no note or memorandum of that agreement, the guarantee was unenforceable. The court could find no support for a distinction between a promise to answer for the debt of another out of general assets and a promise to pay out of a specific asset. Appeal allowed. Claim against the second defendant struck out.",

On receiving the letter the claimant posted a letter of acceptance the same day. However, due to the delay the defendant's had assumed the claimant was not interested in the wool and sold it on to a third party. The claimant sued for breach of contract.",
      "judgment": "There was a valid contract which came in to existence the moment the letter of acceptance was placed in the post box. This case established the postal rule. This applies where post is the agreed form of communication between the parties and the letter of acceptance is correctly addressed and carries the right postage stamp. The acceptance then becomes effective when the letter is posted.",

      "judgment": "The House of Lords held that where the clause limits liability rather than excludes liability altogether the courts should apply the natural meaning of the clause and not be too eager to find ambiguity. Lord Wilberforce stated: “One must not strive to create ambiguities by strained construction, as I think the appellants have striven to do. The relevant words must be given, if possible, their natural, plain meaning. The relevant words must be given, if possible, their natural, plain meaning.

      "category": "Promissory Estoppel",
      "facts": "By contract, the sellers agreed to sell 250 tons of coffee beans at 262 Kenyan shillings per cwt (i.e. per hundredweight) to El Nasr payable on credit. At the time of the contract the value of Kenyan shillings and pound sterling were of equal value. Whilst the contract stipulated the price payable in Kenyan shillings, the credit account referred payment in pound sterling. There were a number of other discrepancies between the credit agreement and contract such as date of shipping and the quantity to be shipped. These other discrepancies were rectified in a revised agreement however, the new agreement still referred to payment in pound sterling. The sellers accepted the first instalment of 57,000 in pound sterling without objection, however, the value of the pound dropped quite dramatically resulting in a loss of 165,530.45 shillings. The sellers then sought to revert to Kenyan shillings and demanded the further payment. The buyers raised promissory estoppel in their defence in that in accepting the instalment in pound sterling and redrafting the credit agreement without changing the currency there was an implied promise that they would not revert to Kenyan Shillings. The sellers argued that the buyers had not acted to their detriment in reliance of this promise as they had gained a benefit.",

AMC had also entered into a duty of care deed with the owner of the site which stipulated that where a lack of reasonable skill and care was found to have been shown by AMC, a remedy was available to the owner at a nominal amount. The deed was assignable to any successor in title. Panatown was a successor. When defects were found, Panatown sought damages against AMC for the delay and the defects (having already received a damages under the duty of care deed). AMC appealed.",
      "judgment": "The appeal by AMC was allowed. It was held that since the employer was not party to the original contract, they had no grounds to seek damages for delay and defects, especially where the terms of the duty of care deed had already been exercised. The employer had suffered no financial loss so could not claim more than the nominal damages that were already determined by the duty of care deed. The case of Dunlop v Lambert (1839) 6 Cl and F 600, HL(Sc) was distinguished as AMC had signed a contractual duty of care for liability which readily applied to a third party, namely Panatown, if AMC failed to perform their main contractual obligations. Dunlop would only apply in there had been no duty of care deed assignable to Panatown.",

The complainants, Amalgamated Investment and Property Co Ltd, bought this warehouse for £1,710,000. In the process of the sale, the complainants had asked the defendants whether the warehouse was registered as an architectural or historic interest building.

The defendant was informed that it had become a listed building.",
      "judgment": "The Court of Appeal said the listing took effect on 27 September, when the Secretary signed the listing papers. However the contract was not frustrated. It held that Amalgamated had taken on the risk that the building could be listed. This was shown by the nature of their pre-contractual enquiries.

He escaped in 1966 and fled to the Soviet Union. He received a publishing contract for a book release in 1989, with Jonathan Cape Ltd. The information in the book was no longer confidential. Blake received advanced payments and was entitled to more. The Crown brought an action for all the profits he made on the book including those that he had not yet received.

This was an exceptional case. Blake had harmed the public interest. Publication was a further breach of his undertaking of confidentiality. Disclosure of non-confidential information was also a criminal offence under the Official Secrets Act 1911. An absolute rule against disclosure was necessary to ensure that the secret service was able to deal in complete confidence. It was in the Crown's legitimate interest to ensure Blake did not benefit from revealing state information. The normal contractual remedies of damages, specific performance or injunction were not enough, and the publishers should pay any money owing to Blake to the Crown.",

      "attribute": "[1993] QB 109",
      "category": "Undue Influence",
      "facts": "The defendants were a married couple who took out a second mortgage on their home as security for overdraft facilities extended by Barclays to the husband’s company. The wife had no interest in the business. Before execution, the branch manager advised the couple to seek legal advice prior to signing the documents. The wife eventually signed the documents relying solely on her husband’s (false) representation that the deed was limited to £60,000 and would last three weeks only. In the end, the husband’s company reached a £154,000 overdraft, as a result of which Barclays sought an order for possession of the mortgage security – i.e. the couple’s home. The wife appealed.",
      "judgment": "The defence based on undue influence failed because the wife was held to exercise independence of thought on financial matters and was used to dealing with the family finances whilst her husband was working away. The wife was successful with regards to misrepresentation. The charge was set aside as the bank had constructive notice of the misrepresentation and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the charge had been obtained without influence or that Mrs O'Brien was aware of the full extent of liability.",

      "facts": "Two brand new engine analyser machines owned by Customs and Exise were put up for auction by the defendant auctioneer. Each could be procured from the manufacturer for £14,521 but despite this were listed without a reserve price. The auctioneer failed to obtain bids of £5000 and £3000, upon which the claimant bid £200 for each machine, but the auctioneer refused to accept these bids and withdrew the machines from auction. A few days later the machines were sold for £750 each through an advert in a magazine. The claimant brought proceedings against the defendant, contending that in an auction without a reserve price the auctioneer was bound to deliver the goods to the highest bidder.",
      "judgment": "The Court held that the holding of an auction for sale without reserve is an offer by the auctioneer to sell to the highest bidder, so the defendant was contractually obliged to sell to the claimant. The reasoning behind this was that the auctioneer acted as agent of the owner in the formation of the contract with the highest bidder, and this gave rise to a collateral contract with the auctioneer himself. There was consideration in the form of detriment to the bidder, as his bid could be accepted unless and until it was withdrawn, and benefit to the auctioneer as the price was driven up (and also that attendance at the auction is likely to increase if it is said that there is no reserve).",

But the judge had been right that Messer's exclusion of liability for s 14 SGA 1979 was unreasonable. As a supplier, rather than manufacturer, this represented that it complied with BS 4105, the required purity level at the time. Although you could comply with BS 4105, this did not mean the carbon dioxide was suitable for use. The exclusion was unreasonable because it contradicted the assumption that manufacture and supply would exclude introduction of foreign elements.

      "facts": "The claimant had agreed to let specific premises to the defendants. A letter was sent to the defendants specifying that the current market rental value of the property in question was £65,000. This was then agreed to constitute an offer which the defendants accepted. The offer was in fact made by the claimant’s solicitors and was constructed upon a mistake. The real price that they were supposed to specify in the offer was actually £126,000. The claimants were contacted and the mistake was pointed out.",
      "judgment": "The court held that the contract was not rendered void by the mistake, as an objective approach was taken. However, the decision is controversial due to offerees being entitled to create legal rights for themselves by merely accepting an offer, when they have in no way relied upon the offer and also being informed that it was a mistake, not reflecting the intention of the offeror.",

There was a notice on the beach next to the deck chairs stating that the deck chairs could be hired at 2d for three hours and also 'respectfully requested' the public to obtain tickets issued by the chair attendants. The claimant obtained a ticket and put it in his pocket without reading it. In fact there was an exclusion clause printed on the ticket excluding the council's liability for personal injury caused in using the deck chair. The claimant was injured when he sat on the chair. The fabric of the deck chair split away from the frame. He brought an action against the council and they sought to rely on the exclusion clause contained in the ticket.",
      "judgment": "The exclusion clause was not incorporated into the contract. A reasonable person would regard the ticket as nothing more than a receipt and would not expect it to contain contractual terms. Furthermore, the wording of the notice suggested that a person could obtain the deck chair and get a ticket later. The notice constituted an offer and collecting the chair would amount to acceptance. It would not be open to the council to introduce new terms after the contract had been formed.",

Chappel owned the copyright in one of the records offered and disputed the right of Nestle to offer the records and sought an injunction to prevent the sales of the records which normally retailed at 6 shillings 8d. Under s.8 of the Copyright Act 1956 retailers were protected from breach of copyright if they gave notice to the copyright holders of the ordinary retail selling price and paid them 6.25% of this. Nestle gave notice stating the ordinary selling price was the 1 shilling 6d and three chocolate bar wrappers. The question for the court was whether the chocolate bar wrappers formed part of the consideration. If they did it was impossible to ascertain the value they represented and therefore Nestle would not have complied with their obligation to give notice of the ordinary retail selling price. If the wrappers were a mere token or condition of sale rather than constituting consideration, then the notice would be valid and Nestle could sell the records.",

The fact that the wrappers were simply to be thrown away did not detract from this.

Chartbrook calculated this to mean £4,484,862 but Persimmon said on a proper construction the amount was £897,051.

Under r 8 of the 1994 Reg’s (now r 12) the DG sought an injunction to stop the bank using the term, because it was unfair.

      "facts": "A ship was chartered to the defendants for a 2 year period. The agreement included a term that the ship would be seaworthy throughout the period of hire. The problems developed with the engine of the ship and the engine crew were incompetent. Consequently the ship was out of service for a 5 week period and then a further 15 week period. The defendants treated this as a breach of condition and ended the contract. The claimants brought an action for wrongful repudiation arguing the term relating to seaworthiness was not a condition of the contract.",
      "judgment": "The defendants were liable for wrongful repudiation. The court introduced the innominate term approach. Rather than seeking to classify the term itself as a condition or warranty, the court should look to the effect of the breach and ask if the breach has substantially deprived the innocent party of the whole benefit of the contract. Only where this is answered affirmatively is it to be a breach of condition. 20 weeks out of a 2 year contract period did not substantially deprive the defendants of whole benefit and therefore they were not entitled to repudiate the contract.",

In fact the entry in Lloyds register was wrong. The capacity was in fact much lower. Consequently the work carried out by Ogden took much longer and cost a great deal more to perform. The claimant brought an action for negligent misrepresentation. HM argued that they had reasonable grounds for believing the statement to be true as they had checked Lloyds register.",

The contract stated that the contract could not be assigned unless there had been written consent of the contractor. The second defendants subcontracted the work to Lenesta. After the work was completed, more asbestos was found which should have been removed. The lessee contracted with the third defendants to remove the asbestos and also assigned its leasehold interest to Linden Gardens. The second defendants were not asked and did not consent to the assignment. More asbestos was found and Linden had work carried out for its removal at their own expense and sued all of the defendants for a breach of contract. Initially, the plaintiff was able to recover damages as the assignment was deemed effective. The defendants appealed.",

The clause of the contract prohibiting assignment without the consent of the contractor was interpreted and upheld literally within its meaning. The original lessee had failed to seek the contractor’s consent. As such without that consent, any benefit of the contract and the assignment of any entitlement to a cause in action was not passed on to Linden. The court held it would be contrary to public policy to allow an assignment of rights where no consent had been given and was expressly required.

However, that Nigerian company failed to enter into the sub-charterparty, and the Charterer failed to perform the fixture.As a result of the Charterer’s repudiation, the expense incurred by the Shipowner in installing the crane was wasted. The Shipowner claimed damages for such expenses.",

The son stated the car was a 1948 model and on that basis the Oscar Chess offered £290 off the purchase price of the Hillman. Without this discount Williams would not have been able to go through with the purchase. 8 months later Oscar Chess ltd found out that the car was in fact a 1939 model and worth much less than thought.

The defendant could have sued for specific performance of the agreement but this would have delayed matters and damaged the company's reputation. The defendant had taken legal advice on all these matters before agreeing to the guarantee and indemnity. The claimant then sought to enforce the guarantee and the defendant sought to have the agreement set aside for economic duress.",
      "judgment": "There was no economic duress. The Privy Council identified 4 factors to consider in assessing whether economic duress was present: 1) Did the person claiming to be coerced protest? 2) Did that person have any other available course of action? 3) Were they independently advised? 4) After entering into the contract, did they take steps to avoid it? In the present case the defendant did not protest at the time. He also could have enforced the contract of sale through specific performance and thus had another avenue of redress available to him. He had taken legal advice and took no steps to avoid the agreement prior to the claimant seeking to enforce the guarantee. Therefore no economic duress could be established.

Federated Foundries then purchased a controlling share in the company and altered the company's Articles of Association giving them the power to remove directors. They then dismissed the claimant as a director who brought an action for wrongful dismissal. There was no breach of contract for his dismissal based on the employment contract as they had not dismissed him from being a managing director but only as a director. However, if he was not a director he was not able to be a managing director. The claimant asked the court to imply a term that the defendant would not act in a way making it incapable for him to perform his contract.",

The victim should be placed in the position as if the contract were performed. The court should not ignore facts that were available. Golden was trying to argue for compensation exceeding the value of what it had lost. Lord Bingham, dissenting, would have held that damages should be assessed on the date of the breach.
